# House-Prices

A brief web application to attempt to demonstrate the use of Flask to give predictions from a pre-created model.  Uses Heroku for deployment.

The website on Heroku can be found here: https://intense-beyond-75647.herokuapp.com/

See https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview for more details the data used to create this model.  You will also need to download the data from that website as the data isn't hosted here.
